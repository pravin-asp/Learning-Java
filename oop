OOP - Object Oriented Proramming

class
object
inheritance
polymorphism
abstraction
encapsulation

class - a blue print containing a set of 
		attributes and behaviors that define
		an item
		
		
Encapsulation - binding state and behavior together into single unit

Acces Modifier - encapsulation is achieved
		Private - only visible in the class that the member lives in
		Protected - visible to the package and all subclasses
		Public - accessible every where in the program
		

Inheritance - code is organized through class 
				hierarchies
			
			code reusability and scalability
				
		Subclass - inherites properties
				 - child class
					
		Superclass - is inherited from
				   - parent class
				   
				   
			Typers of inheritance
				- Single inheritance 
				- Hierarchical inheritance
				- Multilevel inheritance
				- Multiple inheritance
				- hybrid inheritance
				
				extends - key word for inheritance
				
		Polymorphism
			the ability of an object or function ot 
				to take many different forms.
				
			types:
				run time polymorphism
				compile time polymorphism
				
			more reusabile codes are made
			
Abstraction
	helps us hide implementation
	
	abstract classes 
	interfaces 
	
	abstract classes used ot read a files in java
	
Interface - is a set of method signatures for
		to-be-implemented functionally
		
	implements - key word used for interface
